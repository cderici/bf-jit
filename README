This is a brainfuck interpreter in rpython to experiment on optimizations.

Basically I'll try to make this go faster.

This is initialized with PyPy tutorial by Andrew Brown, BF interpreter in RPython, translatable by PyPy, with JIT, and with a get_printable_location function and pure function wrapper for the dictionary lookup.
